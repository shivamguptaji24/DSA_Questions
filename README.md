# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! 🚀 This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems, implemented in **Java**. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository is organized into different categories of DSA concepts, with each folder containing:
- Java code implementations
- Explanation of the solution (if required)
- Optimal approaches with time and space complexities

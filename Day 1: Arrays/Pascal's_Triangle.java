/*
This problem has three variations :
  1. Variation 1(No Direct Problem): Given row number r and column number c. Print the element at position (r, c) in Pascal's triangle.
  2. Variation 2(Leetcode 119): Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascal's triangle.
  3. Variation 3(Leetcode 118: Given the number of rows n. Print the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
*/

// Variation 1

/*
We can optimize this calculation by the following observation. 
Assume, given r = 7, c = 4. 
Now, n = r-1 = 7-1 = 6 and r = c-1 = 4-1 = 3
Letâ€™s calculate 6C3 = 6! / (3! *(6-3)!) = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / ((3*2*1)*(3*2*1))
This will boil down to (6*5*4) / (3*2*1)
So, nCr = (n*(n-1)*(n-2)*.....*(n-r+1)) / (r*(r-1)*(r-2)*....1)
                                
Now, we will use this optimized formula to calculate the value of nCr. But while implementing this into code we will take the denominator in the forward direction like: 

(n / 1)*((n-1) / 2)*.....*((n-r+1) / r).
The code will be like the following:


Approach:
The steps are as follows:

1. First, we will consider r-1 as n and c-1 as r.
2. After that, we will simply calculate the value of the combination using a loop. 
3. The loop will run from 0 to r. And in each iteration, we will multiply (n-i) with the result and divide the result by (i+1).
4. Finally, the calculated value of the combination will be our answer.

Time Complexity: O(c), where c = given column number.
Reason: We are running a loop for r times, where r is c-1.
Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

// Variation 3

/*
It can be solve by two approach :-
  1. Naive Approach
  2. Optimal Approach
*/

// Naive Approach

/*
The naive approach is basically a combination of variation 1 and variation 2. Here, for every row from 1 to n, we will try to generate all the row elements by simply using the naive approach of variation 2. So, we will use the same code as variation 2(naive approach), inside a loop (i.e. row runs from 1 to n).

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

1. First, we will run a loop(say row) from 1 to n.
2. We will use a loop(say col) to iterate over each column i.e. from 1 to n. And inside the nested loops, we will do the following steps:
      a. First, we will consider row-1 as n and col-1 as r.
      b. After that, we will simply calculate the value of the combination using a loop. 
      c. The loop will run from 0 to r. And in each iteration, we will multiply (n-i) with the result and divide the result by (i+1).
      d. Finally, we will add the element to a temporary list.
3. After calculating all the elements for all columns of a row, we will add the temporary list to our final answer list.
4. Finally, we will return the answer list.

Time Complexity: O(n*n*r) ~ O(n3), where n = number of rows, and r = column index.
Reason: The row loop will run for approximately n times. And generating a row using the naive approach of variation 2 takes O(n*r) time complexity.
Space Complexity: In this case, we are only using space to store the answer. That is why space complexity can be still considered as O(1).

class Solution {
    public int nCr(int n, int r) {
        long res = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < r; i++) {
            res = res * (n - i);
            res = res / (i + 1);
        }
        return (int) res;
    }

    public List<List<Integer>> generate(int numRows) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int row = 1; row <= numRows; row++) {
            List<Integer> tempLst = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int col = 1; col <= row; col++) {
                tempLst.add(nCr(row - 1, col - 1));
            }
            ans.add(tempLst);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

// Optimal Approach

/*
Now, in the optimal approach of variation 2, we have learned how to generate a row in O(n) time complexity. So, in order to optimize the overall time complexity, we will be using that approach for every row. Thus the total time complexity will reduce.

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

1. First, we will run a loop(say row) from 1 to n.
2. Inside the loop, we will call a generateRow() function and add the returned list to our final answer. Inside the function we will do the following:
      a. First, we will store the 1st element i.e. 1 manually.
      b. After that, we will use a loop(say col) that runs from 1 to n-1. It will store the rest of the elements.
      c. Inside the loop, we will use the specified formula to print the element. We will multiply the previous answer by (row-col) and then divide it by col itself.
      d. Thus, the entire row will be stored and returned.
3. Finally, we will return the answer list.

Time Complexity: O(n2), where n = number of rows(given).
Reason: We are generating a row for each single row. The number of rows is n. And generating an entire row takes O(n) time complexity.
Space Complexity: In this case, we are only using space to store the answer. That is why space complexity can still be considered as O(1).
